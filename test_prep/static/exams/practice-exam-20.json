      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "- When your web traffic is geo-dispersed, it's not always feasible and certainly not cost effective to replicate your entire infrastructure across the globe.\n- A CDN provides you the ability to utilize its global network of edge locations to deliver a cached copy of web content such as videos, webpages, images and so on to your customers.\n- To reduce response time, the CDN utilizes the nearest edge location to the customer or originating request location in order to reduce the response time.\n- Throughput is dramatically increased given that the web assets are delivered from cache.\n- For dynamic data, many CDNs can be configured to retrieve data from the origin servers.\nReference: <https://aws.amazon.com/caching/>\n</details>",
