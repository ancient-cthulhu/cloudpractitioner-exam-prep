      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "- To use Amazon EC2, you simply:\n- Select a pre-configured, templated Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to get up and running immediately. Or create an AMI containing your applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings.\n- Configure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.\n- Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.\n- Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.\n- Pay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.\nReference: <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/>\n</details>",

        "- A. Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.",
        "- B. Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.",

        "- D. Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "- Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.).\n- Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.\n- That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can\nsimply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.\nReference: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html>\n</details>",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "- Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.\n- The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.\n- This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.\n- So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.\nReference: <https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/>\n</details>",

      "correct_answer": "BE",
      "explanation": "- If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.\n- This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.\n- For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.\nReference: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/>\n</details>",
