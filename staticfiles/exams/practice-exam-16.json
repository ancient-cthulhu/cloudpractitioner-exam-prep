      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "- Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads.\n- When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ).\n- Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable.\n- In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.\n- Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.\nReference: <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/>\n</details>",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "- IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies.\n- Your components need to be loosely coupled to avoid changes or failure in one of the components from affecting others.\n- Your infrastructure also needs to have well defined interfaces that allow the various components to interact with each other only through specific, technology-agnostic interfaces.\n- Modifying any underlying operations without affecting other components should be made possible.\nReference: <https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/>\n</details>",

      "explanation": "- Your root account should always be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n- This additional layer of security helps protect against unauthorized logins to your account by requiring two factors: something you know (a password) and something you have (for example, an MFA device).\n- AWS supports virtual and hardware MFA devices and U2F security keys.\n- Cognito can be used as an Identity Provider (IdP), where it stores and maintains users and credentials securely for your applications, or it can be integrated with OpenID Connect, SAML, and other popular web identity providers like Amazon.com.\n- Using Amazon Cognito, you can generate temporary access credentials for your clients to access AWS services, eliminating the need to store long-term credentials in client applications.\nReference: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/>\n</details>",
